2. Employee must have company_id
3. One User can have multiple brands
4. One User can have multiple work schedules
5. One User can have one work shift in a day
6. We not use spatie permission we use role model instead
7. We don't use manager_id in application
8. Role use roles -> user_roles table because 1 users can have multiple roles
